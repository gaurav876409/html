        <p align="left">Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes 
            for achievement or reward as well. They can be played alone, in teams, 
            or online; by amateurs or by professionals. The players may have an 
            audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching 
            a chess championship. On the other hand, players in a game may constitute 
            their own audience as they take their turn to play. Often, part of the 
            entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their 
            audience and who is a player. A toy and a game are not the same. Toys generally 
            allow for unrestricted play whereas games come with present rules.</p>
