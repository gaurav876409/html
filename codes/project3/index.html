                    <p>A.P.J. Abdul Kalam, in full Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam, (born October 15, 1931,
                        Rameswaram, India—died July 27, 2015, Shillong), Indian scientist and politician who played a
                        leading role in the development of India's missile and nuclear weapons programs. He was
                        president of India from 2002 to 2007.Kalam earned a degree in aeronautical engineering from the
                        Madras Institute of Technology and in 1958 joined the Defence Research and Development
                        Organisation (DRDO). In 1969 he moved to the Indian Space Research Organisation, where he was
                        project director of the SLV-III, the first satellite launch vehicle that was both designed and
                        produced in India. Rejoining DRDO in 1982, Kalam planned the program that produced a number of
                        successful missiles, which helped earn him the nickname “Missile Man.” Among those successes was
                        Agni, India's first intermediate-range ballistic missile, which incorporated aspects of the
                        SLV-III and was launched in 1989. Kalam easily won the election and was sworn in as India's 11th
                        president, a largely ceremonial post, in July 2002.</p>
